# Sans-Holiday-Hack-Walkthroughs
Storage for my walkthroughs on the Annual SANS Holiday Hack (otherwise known as KringleCon).

The SANS Holiday Hack takes place every year around Christmas time and contains a wide variety of awesome security focused challenges. 
It is an event I look forward to every year and one that I attempt to complete and write-up each year. 

In the spirit of sharing knowledge I have included my past year walkthroughs for anyone that wants to go through old challenges and is stuck.
